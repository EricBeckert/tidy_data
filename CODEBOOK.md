# Description of the "tidy_set_week4.txt" file.
The file contains the average of the mean() and std() values of several feature computations, for each activity and each subject in the underlying experiment data. It contains 4 columns:
1. "activity_name": the activity the subject (person) was performing. Possible values:
	* LAYING
	* SITTING
	* STANDING
	* WALKING
	* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
2. "subject_nr": the number of the subject or person performing the activity. Possible values: 
	* 1 to 30
3. "variable": the name of the feature computation
4. "mean_value": the average of the values of each feature, computed for each activity and subject

The data set is of a "long" form, due to the generalized "variable" column.
